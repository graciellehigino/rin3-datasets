From Ask A Manager: "This data does not reflect the general population; it reflects Ask a Manager readers who self-selected to respond, which is a very different group (as you can see just from the demographic breakdown below, which is very white and very female)."


Description: This data was collected by the Ask A Manager blog and used to create this blog post: https://www.askamanager.org/2021/05/some-findings-from-24000-peoples-salaries.html


The survey data set contains variables that are survey questions and it has been cleaned from it's original form to be easier for beginners to work with.

************
PLEASE NOTE: This data contains salaries in many different local currencies, so the annual_salary field cannot be summed without first grouping by currency.
